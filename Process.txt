pointing in time copy the EBS volume

EBS volumes are block-level of storage that you can attach to EC2 instance to provide additional storage

An EC2 snapshot captures the data on an EBS volume, including the operating system, applications, and any data stored on the volume, at
a specific moment

snapshots allows you to create backup of your EBS volume.in the event of data loss or correption you can use these snapshots to restore 
your volumes to a previous state


snapshots can be used to migrate EBS volumes across different regions or availability zones



these also optimizing storage space and redusing costs

create snapcat in the volume
in the snapchat create volume to the snapchat
rm sai
Attach the Snapchot created volume in the volumes
